<h3>Marketplace Client</h3>

<p>Marketplace Client is a rich client solution for installing
solutions listed on <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/">Eclipse
Marketplace</a> directly from an Eclipse Installation.</p>

<p>The Eclipse community has hundreds, if not thousands, of
third-party plugins that users can add to their Eclipse
installation. Unfortunately, there is not easy way to discover and
install these solutions from within Eclipse.</p>

<p>The Eclipse Foundation operates a website, called
<a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/">Eclipse
Marketplace</a>, that provides a listing of Eclipse-based
solutions. The listings allow each solution provider to specify a P2
repository for their solution. Eclipse users now have a central
catalog to find Eclipse solutions but the install process is still
not tightly integrated with the Eclipse workspace.</p>

<p>MPC provides the tight install integration between the Eclipse
workspace and Eclipse Marketplace, plus other third party solution
listings. MPC is included in all of the EPP packages.</p>

<h4>NOTE: Problem in Luna version</h4>
<p style="border: 1px dashed; background-color: #ffd;">
The Marketplace Client version released with Eclipse Luna contains a <a href="">bug</a> rendering the Market and Category selectors in the MPC wizard unusable.<br/><br/>Please update your Marketplace Client from <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/mpc/luna">http://download.eclipse.org/mpc/luna</a> to get a fix for this issue.
