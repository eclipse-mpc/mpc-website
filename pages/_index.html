<h3>Marketplace Client</h3>

<p>Marketplace Client is a rich client solution for installing
solutions listed on <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/">Eclipse
Marketplace</a> directly from an Eclipse Installation.</p>

<p>The Eclipse community has hundreds, if not thousands, of
third-party plugins that users can add to their Eclipse
installation. Unfortunately, there is not easy way to discover and
install these solutions from within Eclipse.</p>

<p>The Eclipse Foundation operates a website, called
Eclipse Marketplace, that provides a listing of Eclipse-based
solutions. The listings allow each solution provider to specify a P2
repository for their solution. Eclipse users now have a central
catalog to find Eclipse solutions but the install process is still
not tightly integrated with the Eclipse workspace.</p>

<p>MPC provides the tight install integration between the Eclipse
workspace and Eclipse Marketplace, plus other third party solution
listings. MPC is included in many of the EPP packages.</p>
